Tests      - Add tests for Safari, IE8
Parsing    - Refactor the interface.  A few areas could be tightened up (somewhat done?).


Done by 1.0:

- Add utilties
	- multipart/form-data parsing
    - x-www-form-urlencoded
- More tests
    - clean up tests a bit
    - use new DictCompare method
- API freeze
- Proper error handling in URI parsing
- I don't like the location of PointyURI, namespace wise
- Fix up example physical directories
- Double-check proper event handling disposal; memory leaks are bad :(

Done by 1.1:
- Good documentation (human, XML docs)
- More tests
- Helpers
    - Wrappers for Pointy URL dispatchers that handle common tasks
	    - A thread pooling dispatcher that fires response callbacks
		  outside of the socket async threads
	    - A "simple" wrapper that provides a non-streaming response API

Done by 1.2:
- SSL
- IPv6 in URI parsing
- IPv6 support in server

Distant future:
- Event-driven server implementation, similar to node.js.  This will require a more "open" parser and
  some large changes to the internals, but will give a large boost to flexibility.
- Aggresive Powernap optimizations.  Method-based profiling has been done already, but the actual state
  machine hasn't been optimized at all yet, which might let us squeeze some more performance out of it.
