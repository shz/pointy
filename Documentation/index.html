    <h1>Pointy Documentation</h1>
    <p>Alas, entirely unwritten.  The actual operation is fairly straightforward,
    however; take a look at the examples (they're painless, I promise) to get
    an idea of how to use it.  From there you can pretty much just rely on
    XML docs to get the hang of the rest.</p>
    
    <p>If you're building an application that makes use of some more "serious"
    HTTP features you'll more than likely end up making use of <code>Pointy.Util</code>,
    which provides the following classes:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FormUrlencoded</strong> &mdash; Decodes/encodes data using <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code></li>
      <li><strong>MimeType</strong> &mdash; Provides MIME header parsing/generation tools</code></li>
      <li><strong>UrlEncoding</strong> &mdash; Decodes/encodes data using URL encoding</li>
    </ul>
